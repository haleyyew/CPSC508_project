\title{Exploring Error Checking and Correction Protocols} 


\author{Haoran Yu}

\begin{abstract}
Data may become corrupted under many situations. For example, while transmitting a message over the network, noise could introduce error making the message unreadable by the receiver; a disk storing files could fail and lose part or all of the files. In this project, I explored and modified the Xv6 kernel slightly, to allow services such as checking for error in corrupted data and correcting the error. At the user level, multiple system calls were introduced to perform distinct services at the kernel level. Several protocols for error correction were implemented, including RAID level 1 and RAID level 4. An attempt was made to implement Reed-Solomon erasure code, but it was not successful.
